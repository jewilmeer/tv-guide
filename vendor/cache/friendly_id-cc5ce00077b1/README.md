# FriendlyId

**NOTE**

The master branch of this repository now contains FriendlyId 5, which is in
active development and not yet stable. This is the branch you need for Rails 4
compatibility.

For FriendlyId 4, the current stable release, please see the [4.0-stable
branch](https://github.com/FriendlyId/friendly_id/tree/4.0-stable). Note that
this release is only compatible with Rails 3.2 and 3.1.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FriendlyId/friendly_id.png)](https://travis-ci.org/FriendlyId/friendly_id)

FriendlyId is the "Swiss Army bulldozer" of slugging and permalink plugins for
Ruby on Rails. It allows you to create pretty URLs and work with human-friendly
strings as if they were numeric ids for Active Record models.

Using FriendlyId, it's easy to make your application use URLs like:

    http://example.com/states/washington

instead of:

    http://example.com/states/4323454


## FriendlyId Features

FriendlyId offers many advanced features, including: slug history and
versioning, i18n, scoped slugs, reserved words, and custom slug generators.

Note: FriendlyId 5.0 is compatible with Active Record **4.0** and higher only.
For Rails 3.x, please use FriendlyId 4.x.


## Version 5.x

As of version 5.0, FriendlyId uses semantic versioning. Therefore, as you might
infer from the version number, FriendlyId 5.0 introduces changes incompatible
with 4.x.

Here's a summary of the most important changes:

* FriendlyId no longer overrides `find`. If you want to do friendly finds, you
  must do `Model.friendly.find` rather than `Model.find`.

* Version 5.0 offers a new "candidates" functionality which makes it easy to
  set up a list of alternate slugs that can be used to uniquely distinguish
  records, rather than appending a sequence. For example:

```ruby
class Restaurant < ActiveRecord::Base
  extend FriendlyId
  friendly_id :slug_candidates, use: :slugged

  # Try building a slug based on the following fields in
  # increasing order of specificity.
  def slug_candidates
    [
      :name,
      [:name, :city],
      [:name, :street, :city],
      [:name, :street_number, :street, :city]
    ]
  end
end
```

* Now that candidates have been added, FriendlyId no longer uses a numeric
  sequence to differentiate conflicting slug, but rather a GUID. This makes the
  codebase simpler and more reliable when running concurrently, at the expense
  of uglier ids being generated when there are conflicts.

* The Globalize module has been removed and will be released as its own gem.
  Note that it has not yet been developed.

* The default sequence separator is now `-` rather than `--`.

* Like Rails 4, FriendlyId now requires Ruby 1.9.3 or higher.

## Docs

The current docs can always be found
[here](http://rubydoc.info/github/FriendlyId/friendly_id/master/frames).

The best place to start is with the
[Guide](http://rubydoc.info/github/FriendlyId/friendly_id/master/file/Guide.rdoc),
which compiles the top-level RDocs into one outlined document.

You might also want to watch Ryan Bates's [Railscast on FriendlyId](http://railscasts.com/episodes/314-pretty-urls-with-friendlyid),
which is now somewhat outdated but still mostly relevant.

## Rails Quickstart

```shell
rails new my_app
cd my_app
```
```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'friendly_id', github: 'FriendlyId/friendly_id', branch: 'master' # Note: You MUST use 5.0.0 or greater for Rails 4.0+
```
```shell
rails generate scaffold user name:string slug:string
```
```ruby
# edit db/migrate/*_create_users.rb
add_index :users, :slug, unique: true
```
```shell
rake db:migrate
```
```ruby
# edit app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  extend FriendlyId
  friendly_id :name, use: :slugged
end

User.create! name: "Joe Schmoe"

# Change User.find to User.friendly.find in your controller
User.friendly.find(params[:id])
```
```shell
rails server

GET http://localhost:3000/users/joe-schmoe
```
```ruby
# If you're adding FriendlyId to an existing app and need
# to generate slugs for existing users, do this from the
# console, runner, or add a Rake task:
User.find_each(&:save)
```

## Bugs

Please report them on the [Github issue
tracker](http://github.com/FriendlyId/friendly_id/issues) for this project.

If you have a bug to report, please include the following information:

* **Version information for FriendlyId, Rails and Ruby.**
* Full stack trace and error message (if you have them).
* Any snippets of relevant model, view or controller code that shows how you
  are using FriendlyId.

If you are able to, it helps even more if you can fork FriendlyId on Github,
and add a test that reproduces the error you are experiencing.
